Handle display screen reloading, i.e. when display connects if there are any players send them all.
^ will not work, we don't know their x,y... (unless we keep sending it back to the server for this purpose.)

Handle player screen refreshing? - store player id in cookie or local storage, but how to get server to
use this uuid instead of creating a new player?


static assets are served via http-kit, this is okay for local dev, but on server Apache (or whatever) should serve these.
they also do not have caching headers. Ideally we also add digest. But this can come later.
However apache will not be able to see inside jar, so instead http-kit can serve and apache can cache.



display should report its size to server so it can set world size (used for rand x,y of new players)

namespace game (join + display) so we can have multiple games

## Tag game

store player object(s) 
  top/left (x,y), top/right, bottom/left, botton/right

prevent player going out of bounds
  do not move if x is less than 0 or x is greater than (boundary - player width)
  same for y

player continues to move in same direction until another button pressed
  needs game loop, called every X seconds which will move player in current direction

when more than one player joined randomly choose "it"

add points (increase while not "it")
decrease points while "it" until zero
points done on server side and pushed to mobile devices

detect collision between players
  it x,y is within another players x,y + height/width (i.e bounding box)
  collision with "it" changes "it" to other player
push points to mobile device

game lasts for X mins, player with most points at end wins.
