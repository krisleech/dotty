Automatic reload of code

holding control should send multiple events - nope.

Handle display screen reloading, i.e. when display connects if there are any players send them all.
^ will not work, we don't know their x,y... (unless we keep sending it back to the server for this purpose.)

Handle player screen refreshing? - store player id in cookie or local storage, but how to get server to
use this uuid instead of creating a new player?


static assets are served via http-kit, this is okay for local dev, but on server Apache (or whatever) should serve these.
they also do not have caching headers. Ideally we also add digest. But this can come later.
However apache will not be able to see inside jar, so instead http-kit can serve and apache can cache.



display should report its size to server so it can set world size (used for rand x,y of new players)
